function [channel] = preRun(acqResults, settings)
%Function initializes tracking channels from acquisition data. The acquired
%signals are sorted according to the signal strength. This function can be
%modified to use other satellite selection algorithms or to introduce
%acquired signal properties offsets for testing purposes.
%
%[channel] = preRun(acqResults, settings)
%
%   Inputs:
%       acqResults  - results from acquisition.
%       settings    - receiver settings
%
%   Outputs:
%       channel     - structure contains information for each channel (like
%                   properties of the tracked signal, channel status etc.).
