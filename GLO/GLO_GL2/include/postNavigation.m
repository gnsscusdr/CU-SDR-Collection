function [navSolutions, eph] = postNavigation(trackResults, settings)
%Function calculates navigation solutions for the receiver (pseudoranges,
%positions). At the end it converts coordinates from the WGS84 system to
%the UTM, geocentric or any additional coordinate system.
%
%[navSolutions, eph] = postNavigation(trackResults, settings)
%
%   Inputs:
%       trackResults    - results from the tracking function (structure
%                       array).
%       settings        - receiver settings.
%   Outputs:
%       navSolutions    - contains measured pseudoranges, receiver
%                       clock error, receiver coordinates in several
%                       coordinate systems (at least ECEF and UTM).
%       eph             - received ephemerides of all SV (structure array).

%% Check is there enough data to obtain any navigation solution ===========
% It is necessary to have at least three strings (number 1, 2 and 3) to
% find satellite coordinates. Then receiver position can be found too.
% The function requires all 15 strings, because the tracking starts at
% arbitrary point. Therefore the first received strings can be any three
% from the 5. One string length is 2 seconds, therefore we need at least
% 30 sec long record (15 * 2 = 30 sec = 30000ms). We add extra seconds
% for the cases, when tracking has started in a middle of a string.
